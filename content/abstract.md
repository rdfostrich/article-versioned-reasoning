## Abstract

<!-- Context      -->
The domain of RDF versioning concerns itself with the storage of different versions of Linked Datasets.
The ability of querying over these versions is an active area of research,
and allows for basic insights to be discovered,
such as tracking the evolution of certain things in datasets.
<!-- Need         -->
Querying can however only get you so far.
In order to _derive_ logical consequences from existing knowledge,
we need to be able to _reason_ over this data,
such as ontology-based inferencing.
<!-- Task         -->
In order to achieve this,
we explore fundamental concepts on _semantic querying_ of versioned datasets
using ontological knowledge.
<!-- Object       -->
In this work, we present these concepts as a semantic extension
of the existing RDF versioning concepts that focus on syntactical versioning.
We remain general and assume that versions do not necessarily
follow a purely linear temporal relation.
<!-- Findings     -->
<!-- Conclusion   -->
This work lays a foundation for reasoning over RDF versions from a querying perspective,
<!-- Perspectives -->
using which RDF versioning storage, query and reasoning systems can be designed.
