## Abstract

<!-- Context      -->
RDF archives are used to store different versions of Linked Datasets
The ability of querying over these versions is an active area of research,
and allows for basic insights to be discovered,
such as tracking the evolution of certain things in datasets.
<!-- Need         -->
Querying can however only get you so far.
In order to make sense of versioned data,
and to derive new knowledge,
we need to be able to _reason_ over this data.

<!-- Task         -->
In order to achieve this,
we explore fundamental concepts on _semantic querying_ of versioned datasets
using ontological knowledge.
<!-- Object       -->
In this work, we present these concepts as a semantic extension
of the existing RDF versioning concepts that focus on syntactical versioning.
<!-- Findings     -->
<!-- Conclusion   -->
This work lays a foundation for reasoning over RDF versions from a querying perspective,
<!-- Perspectives -->
using which RDF versioning storage, query and reasoning systems can be designed.
