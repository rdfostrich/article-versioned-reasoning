## Abstract

TODO: rewrite to focus just on the querying part

<!-- Context      -->
RDF archives are used to store different versions of Linked Datasets
The ability of querying over these versions is an active area of research,
and allows for basic insights to be discovered,
such as tracking the evolution of certain things in datasets.
<!-- Need         -->
Querying can however only get you so far.
In order to make sense of versioned data,
and to derive knowledge,
we need to be able to _reason_ over this data.
<!-- Task         -->
In order to achieve this,
we explore fundamental concepts on semantic storage and querying of versioned datasets
using rule-based reasoning.
<!-- Object       -->
In this work, we present these concepts as a semantic extension
of the existing RDF archiving concepts that focus on syntactical versioning.
<!-- Findings     -->
<!-- Conclusion   -->
This work lays a foundation for semantic changes in RDF archiving
<!-- Perspectives -->
using which RDF archive storage and query systems to be designed.
