## Querying
{:#querying}

As discussed in [](#fundamentals), there exist five foundational query atoms for querying RDF archives.
In this section, we introduce semantic extensions of these query atoms,
similar to the structural diff to semantic diff extension introduced by VÃ¶lkel et al..
More concretely, we will extend these five query atoms with parameters for _language versioning_,
instead of only _dataset versioning_.
